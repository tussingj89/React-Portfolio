    <p>My name is Jack W. Tussing, and I started my coding journey in 2019. Throughout my 15-year career as a diesel mechanic, 
        I lived by the motto of “Never stop learning, and never stop growing.” I strive to bring that same level of drive to coding.
    </p>
    <p>In the years I’ve been coding, I have picked up a long list of skills, which make me a great asset to any team. The most important
        of these skills are my abilities to adapt to new situations easily and pick up new concepts quickly. I intend to keep learning 
        and using my new skills to assist a dynamic company in reaching and staying at the forefront of the ever-changing technology 
        in our world. I began by teaching myself Python, basic HTML/CSS, Javascript, and C++, and in October 2020 I began a web 
        development bootcamp through Butler University.
    </p>
    <p>I'm 31 years old, I'm happily married, and I have a dog and a cat. In my spare time, I love to learn new things and work with my hands.
